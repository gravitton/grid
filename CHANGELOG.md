## [Unreleased](https://github.com/gravitton/grid/compare/v1.1.0...master)


## [v1.1.0 (2026-05-09)](https://github.com/gravitton/grid/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0)
### Added
- `IsometricRectCellSize(width)` — computes the cell size for `NewIsometricRectGrid` at a true 30° isometric angle
- `IsometricPixelPerfectRectCellSize(width)` — computes the cell size for `NewIsometricRectGrid` at a pixel-art-friendly 2:1 (width × width/2) ratio
- `HexFlatTopCellSize(width)` — computes the hex circumradius for `NewHexagonFlatTopGrid` where each tile is exactly `width` pixels wide
- `HexPointyTopCellSize(width)` — computes the hex circumradius for `NewHexagonPointyTopGrid` where each tile is exactly `width` pixels wide
- `RectCellSize(width)` — computes the cell size for `NewRectGrid` for a square `width × width` tile
- `HexFlatTopIsometricPixelPerfectCellSize(width)` — computes the hex circumradius for `NewHexagonFlatTopGrid` at a pixel-perfect isometric width
- `HexPointyTopIsometricPixelPerfectCellSize(width)` — computes the hex circumradius for `NewHexagonPointyTopGrid` at a pixel-perfect isometric width

### Changed
- `Grid.Iter` now automatically selects the correct draw order (painter's algorithm) based on the grid layout — no manual configuration required
- Isometric grids use diagonal depth (`col+row`) ordering; hex flat-top grids use a two-pass even/odd column iteration; hex pointy-top and rectangular grids use row-major order
- `Iter` includes one extra row and column at every edge of the bounds so partially visible tiles are not culled; border cells may be out-of-bounds (`cell.Valid() == false`)


## v1.0.0 (2026-05-06)
### Added
- `Grid[T]` — generic 2D grid with configurable layout, spatial mapping, and graph operations
- `Cell[T]` — single grid cell with value access, spatial info (`Center`, `Bounds`, `Polygon`), and graph methods (`Neighbors`, `DistanceTo`, `Range`, `PathTo`)
- `Array[T]` — low-level flat 2D array with `Get`, `Set`, `Fill`, `Clear`, `Clone`, `Iter`, `Iter2`
- `NewRectGrid[T]` — rectangular grid with 4-directional (cardinal) movement
- `NewIsometricRectGrid[T]` — isometric (diamond-projection) rectangular grid
- `RectGridOpts.DiagonalMovement()` — option to enable 8-directional movement on rectangular grids
- `NewHexagonPointyTopGrid[T]` — hexagonal grid with pointy-top orientation and odd-row offset
- `NewHexagonFlatTopGrid[T]` — hexagonal grid with flat-top orientation and odd-column offset
- `HexGridOpts.EvenSystem()` — option to switch hex offset convention from odd to even
- `Direction` type and eight named constants (`E`, `NE`, `N`, `NW`, `W`, `SW`, `S`, `SE`) with `Opposite()` and `String()` methods
- `System` type — `Cardinal` (4-directional) and `Diagonal` (8-directional) movement modes
- `CardinalDirections`, `DiagonalDirections`, `Directions` — pre-built direction vector arrays; `Directions` is indexed by `Direction` constant
- `NeighborOffsets(system)` — returns direction vectors for the given system
- `NeighborOffset(system, direction)` — returns the unit vector for a single direction; panics if a diagonal direction is passed with `Cardinal`
- `DistanceTo(from, to, system)` — Manhattan distance for `Cardinal`, Chebyshev for `Diagonal`
- `Point` — grid coordinate type with spatial query methods: `Range`, `FieldOfView`, `HasLineOfSight`, `Neighbors`, `DistanceTo`
- `Pt(x, y)` — shorthand constructor for `Point`
- `Layout` — mapping between grid coordinates and pixel space, with `AlignTopLeft`, `MoveTo`, `Resize`, `Add`, `With`
- `Transform` — predefined coordinate mapping for a layout type; built-in: `SquareFlat`, `SquareIsometric`, `HexPointyTop`, `HexFlatTop`
- `NewLayout` / `NewTransform` — constructors for custom grid layouts
- Pathfinding on `Grid[T]`: `Path` (A*), `AStar`, `GreedyBestFirstSearch`, `UniformCostSearch`, `BreadthFirstSearch`, and `*Field` variants returning the full came-from map
- `Grid.Range` — returns all cell indices within Euclidean distance n, filtered through a caller-supplied validity function and a field-of-view algorithm; blocked cells occlude cells behind them (Bresenham on rect grids, hex FoV on hex grids)
- `Grid.Distance` — grid distance between two indices using the configured distance function
- `Grid.Iter` — iterator over all cells or a bounded viewport subset
